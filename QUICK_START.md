## Quick Tips

### Creating Items:
- Aim for 12 items per auction
- Starting bids around $30-50 work well
- Set reserves at your minimum acceptable price
- Reserve is hidden - buyers don't see it

### Scheduling:
- Monthly auctions work best
- Weekend start times get more traffic
- 3-day auction duration is ideal
- Start Friday evening, end Monday evening

### Pricing Strategy:
- Starting bid: Lower to encourage participation
- Reserve: Your actual minimum
- Example: Start at $35, reserve at $80

##  Production Checklist (When Ready)

Want to go live? You'll eventually need:

- [ ] PostgreSQL database (Neon free tier)
- [ ] Clerk authentication (for user accounts)
- [ ] Stripe (for payments)
- [ ] Domain name
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel

But for now, you can run and test everything locally without any of that!
